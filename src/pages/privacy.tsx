              <p className="mb-6">
                Welcome to Credify ("the App," "we," "our," or "us"). By installing,
                accessing, or using Credify, you agree to be bound by these Terms of
                Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use
                the App.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Eligibility and Account Registration</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>1.1 Age Requirement.</strong> You must be at least 18 years old to use Credify. By registering, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>1.2 Account Creation.</strong> To use Credify, you must create an account ("Account") by providing a valid email address and password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. App Features and User Obligations</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>2.1 Perk Tracking.</strong> Credify allows you to manually import credit-card information (card names, annual fees, perk categories, etc.). You are solely responsible for the accuracy, currency, and completeness of all data you enter. We do not have direct access to your full credit-card account details (e.g., account numbers, balances, PINs, or full transaction history).
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>2.2 Perk Information.</strong> We aggregate publicly available data and user-provided details about common credit-card perks. This information may become outdated or inaccurate. You acknowledge that you must verify all perk details (e.g., redemption amounts, categories, expiration windows) with your card issuer. We disclaim any liability for outdated or incorrect perk data.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>2.3 Notifications and Reminders.</strong> Credify can send you notifications for approaching perk expiration or renewal periods. You are responsible for configuring push notifications or email settings. We cannot guarantee you will receive alerts if you disable notifications on your device.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>2.4 One-Tap Redemption.</strong> When you tap a perk, Credify attempts to open the associated third-party app or website (e.g., Uber, Grubhub, airline portals, streaming services) and mark it as used. We do not control those third-party services and are not responsible if they fail to launch, load, or redeem correctly.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>2.5 Usage Prohibitions.</strong> You agree not to:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>Use Credify for any illegal purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law.</li>
                <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying structure of the App.</li>
                <li>Interfere with, disrupt, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to any system, network, or user data.</li>
              </ul>
